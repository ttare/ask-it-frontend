# [Ask.it](https://shielded-lowlands-64643.herokuapp.com/)

### Application description
It is necessary to create an application that allows users to register and after successful registration to ask questions.

All other registered people can give an answer. Also, users can give their rating to the question and answer (thumbs up / down or like and dislike).

### Required functionality

- Homepage
    - list of last 20 questions with load more functionality
    - list of people with the most answers
    - list of questions with the most likes (hot questions)
- Question page
    - display of questions and all details
    - display of all answers
    - if the user is registered, display the form for adding a new answer
- My questions
    - list of the last 20 questions asked by the user with load more functionality
- Login page
- Register page
- Profile page
    - display user information
    - password change form


### Required functionality
- Backend
    - It is necessary to use Mongo, MySQL or PostgreSQL
    - t is necessary to use NodeJS + (Express, Restify or some other framework for Rest API)
    - It is necessary to use JWT for protected routes
- Frontend:
    - ReactJS
    - It is desirable to use additional libraries such as Flux, Redux (preferably Redux)
    - It is desirable that the application be done in accordance with React.JS best practices, where an understanding of the React lifecycle of certain components will be clearly seen.
    - Use some of the popular HTML / CSS frameworks (Bootstrap, Zurb Foundation, Material Design Lite…)
    - Do a deployment on one of the free services like Heroku.

The completed task needs to be placed on the GitHub or Bitbucket repository.
It is desirable that the application be done in accordance with React.JS best practices, where an understanding of the React lifecycle of certain components will be clearly seen.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
